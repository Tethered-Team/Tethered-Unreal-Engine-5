# Tethered Character GAS Integration

## Overview
I have successfully integrated the Gameplay Ability System (GAS) into your existing Tethered character system. This provides a robust foundation for managing character stats, abilities, and progression.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Core GAS Components

#### TetheredAttributeSet (`Source/Tethered/Public/GAS/TetheredAttributeSet.h`)
- **Health Attributes**: Health, MaxHealth, HealthRegenRate
- **Movement Attributes**: MovementSpeed, SprintMultiplier, DashDistance, DashCooldown
- **Combat Attributes**: AttackDamage, AttackSpeed, CritChance, CritMultiplier, DamageResistance
- Full replication and RepNotify support
- Automatic attribute clamping and validation
- Support for attribute-based damage calculations

#### TetheredGameplayAbility (`Source/Tethered/Public/GAS/TetheredGameplayAbility.h`)
- Base class for all abilities in your game
- Helper functions to access character and attribute set
- Proper networking and prediction setup
- Input tag support for ability binding

### 2. Implemented Abilities

#### GA_ComboAttack (`Source/Tethered/Public/GAS/Abilities/GA_ComboAttack.h`)
- Light attack ability with sphere trace damage detection
- Integrates with existing aim assist system for target lunging
- Supports animation montages
- Damage scaling based on attribute values

#### GA_ChargedAttack (`Source/Tethered/Public/GAS/Abilities/GA_ChargedAttack.h`)
- Heavy attack with increased damage multiplier
- Larger attack radius than combo attacks
- Integrates with aim assist for enhanced targeting

#### GA_Dash (`Source/Tethered/Public/GAS/Abilities/GA_Dash.h`)
- Movement ability using character launching
- Distance based on attribute values
- Cooldown system support
- Directional dashing based on input

### 3. Enhanced Character System

#### TetheredCharacter Updates
- Now implements `IAbilitySystemInterface`
- Integrated AbilitySystemComponent and AttributeSet
- Ability activation through input tags
- Attribute change callbacks for UI updates
- Backwards compatibility with existing component system

#### TetheredPlayerController (`Source/Tethered/Public/Controller/TetheredPlayerController.h`)
- GAS-enabled player controller
- Configurable ability bindings per input
- Runtime ability assignment system
- Effect application to possessed characters

### 4. Data Assets

#### TetheredCharacterData (`Source/Tethered/Public/Data/TetheredCharacterData.h`)
- Data-driven character configuration
- Starting attribute effects
- Default ability assignments
- Modular character setup system

## How to Use

### 1. Setting Up a Character
```cpp
// In Blueprint or C++
MyCharacter->SetAbilityBinding(FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag("Input.ComboAttack"), UGA_ComboAttack::StaticClass());
MyCharacter->SetAbilityBinding(FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag("Input.Dash"), UGA_Dash::StaticClass());
```

### 2. Creating Custom Abilities
1. Inherit from `UTetheredGameplayAbility`
2. Override `ActivateAbility()` and `EndAbility()`
3. Set appropriate input tags and ability tags
4. Use `GetTetheredCharacterFromActorInfo()` to access character
5. Use `GetTetheredAttributeSetFromActorInfo()` to access attributes

### 3. Modifying Attributes
```cpp
// Through Gameplay Effects (recommended)
FGameplayEffectSpecHandle EffectSpec = ASC->MakeOutgoingSpec(MyDamageEffect, 1, EffectContext);
EffectSpec.Data->SetSetByCallerMagnitude(FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag("Data.Damage"), DamageAmount);
ASC->ApplyGameplayEffectSpecToSelf(*EffectSpec.Data);

// Direct modification (use sparingly)
AttributeSet->SetHealth(NewHealthValue);
```

### 4. Creating Gameplay Effects in Blueprint
1. Create Blueprint class based on GameplayEffect
2. Set Duration Policy (Instant, Duration, Infinite)
3. Add Modifiers targeting specific attributes
4. Configure magnitude calculations
5. Add gameplay tags as needed

## Key Benefits

1. **Data-Driven**: All stats and abilities configurable without code changes
2. **Networked**: Full replication and prediction support
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add new attributes and abilities
4. **Integrated**: Works with existing aim assist and movement systems
5. **Performance**: Efficient attribute calculations and change detection
6. **Flexible**: Support for temporary effects, cooldowns, and costs

## Next Steps

1. **Create Gameplay Effects in Blueprint** for:
   - Character initialization (starting stats)
   - Damage effects
   - Cooldown effects
   - Temporary stat boosts

2. **Configure Ability Bindings** in your character Blueprint:
   - Set default abilities for each input
   - Configure starting attribute values
   - Set up character progression

3. **Create UI Integration**:
   - Bind to attribute change events
   - Display cooldowns and ability states
   - Show health, damage, etc.

4. **Expand the System**:
   - Add more attributes (mana, stamina, etc.)
   - Create more complex abilities
   - Implement ability upgrades
   - Add status effects

The foundation is now in place for a robust, data-driven ability and stat system that integrates seamlessly with your existing game architecture.
